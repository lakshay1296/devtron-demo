# FIPS Compliance Assessment for Devtron Project

## Overview
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2/140-3 compliance is critical for government and high-security environments. This document outlines the current compliance status and recommendations for the Devtron project.

## Cryptographic Compliance Checklist

### 1. Cryptographic Module Validation
- [ ] Use FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated cryptographic libraries
- [ ] Implement approved encryption algorithms
  * AES-256 for symmetric encryption
  * RSA-2048 or higher for asymmetric encryption
  * SHA-256 or SHA-3 for hashing

### 2. Key Management
- [ ] Implement secure key generation
- [ ] Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanisms
- [ ] Protect key material at rest and in transit

### 3. Authentication Mechanisms
- [ ] Use FIPS-compliant authentication protocols
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Enforce strong password policies
- [ ] Use approved TLS/SSL configurations

### 4. Cryptographic Algorithm Recommendations
```go
// Example FIPS-compliant cryptographic configuration
type FIPSCryptoConfig struct {
    EncryptionAlgorithm string `json:"encryption_algorithm"`
    KeyLength           int    `json:"key_length"`
    HashAlgorithm       string `json:"hash_algorithm"`
}

var fipsConfig = FIPSCryptoConfig{
    EncryptionAlgorithm: "AES",
    KeyLength:           256,
    HashAlgorithm:       "SHA-256",
}
```

### 5. Golang FIPS Considerations
- Use `crypto/subtle` for constant-time comparisons
- Leverage `crypto` package with FIPS mode
- Consider FIPS-validated Go implementations

### 6. Kubernetes and Container Security
- Use FIPS-compliant container runtimes
- Implement network encryption
- Use approved security contexts

### 7. Continuous Compliance Monitoring
- Regular security audits
- Automated compliance checks
- Keep dependencies updated

## Current Compliance Status
- Partial FIPS compliance
- Requires significant architectural modifications

## Recommended Actions
1. Replace cryptographic libraries with FIPS-validated alternatives
2. Implement strict key management
3. Use FIPS-validated TLS configurations
4. Conduct comprehensive security assessment

## Tools for FIPS Validation
- NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)
- NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)

## Performance Considerations
- FIPS-compliant cryptography may introduce performance overhead
- Benchmark and optimize cryptographic operations

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance
- Meets requirements for:
  * Federal agencies
  * Healthcare (HIPAA)
  * Financial institutions
  * Defense contractors

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Cryptographic library assessment
2. Key management redesign
3. Authentication mechanism update
4. Continuous integration of compliance checks
